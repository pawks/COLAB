1. Write an ARM assembly program to WRITE to a file. Write 2 or more lines of text to this file.
   Make sure you close the file after you write to it. Submission due Jan 24th or 25th
2. Write an ARM assembly program to read from the file that you created in Problem 1.
   Open this file in READ mode, READ and dump its contents to STDOUT. Submission due on Jan 24th or 25th.
3. Write an ARM assembly program to receive 3 different Integer inputs from STDIN. After receiving all the three values print them on STDOUT.
   Submission due on Jan 24th or 25th.
4. In some single threaded embedded system applications, we use timers built using assembler sub-routine. This type of routines is sufficient and reasonably accurate for many applications. Develop a subroutine “Stimer” that can create 1000 (approximately) Clock cycles delay. Using this subroutine write another subroutine “Ltimer” that can create delay which are multiples of 10000 (approximately) cycles. The Ltimer is simple and no need to other timers.  The Ltimer can be used to create periodic scan of I/O devices or any periodic activity.  Submission due on Jan 31st or Feb 1st.
5. Write ARM assembly code that can make the two red LEDs in Embest Plugin of ARMSIM to glow alternatively at observable rate. Your code should be user configurable for various rate. User timer developed in problem 4. Submission due on Feb 21st or 22nd.
6. Write ARM assembly code that can make the 8-segment display to go from 0 to 9 at an observable rate. Your code should be user configurable for various rate. Submission due on Feb 21st or 22nd.
